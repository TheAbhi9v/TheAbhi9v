# Hi, I am Abhinav. 

🎓 Student • 💡 Technology Enthusiast • 🚀 Curious Learner

I am driven by curiosity about how technology works — from writing programs in different languages to understanding the tools, systems, and ideas behind modern software.  
I enjoy exploring broadly, learning fundamentals deeply, and improving through consistent experimentation and reflection.
